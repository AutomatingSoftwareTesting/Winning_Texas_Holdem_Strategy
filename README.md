## What is it?

This is a No Limit Texas Hold'em (NLTH) Pre-flop Range Trainer. It gives a player random cards and a
random position at the table. Then, the player has to decide if they would open or fold their hand.
Finally, the application compares the player's decision to the correct decision based off of the selected
 hand range (which is customizable by the user).

development, exception handling, report writing, project implementation, directory navigation, system
design, and data analysis concepts.
