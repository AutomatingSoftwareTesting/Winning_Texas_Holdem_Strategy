# Winning Texas Hold'em Strategy

## What is it?

This is a No Limit Texas Hold'em (NLTH) Pre-flop Range Trainer. It gives a player random cards and a random position at the table. Then, the player has to decide if they would open or fold their hand. Finally, the application compares the player's decision to the correct decision based off of the selected hand range (which is customizable by the user).

## Additional Information

This project was created to help me demonstrate several skills I've acquired during my past several jobs.

Specifically, I've included: object oriented programming, automated testing, systems testing, functional development (variables, decisions, functions, loops), exception handling, report writing, project implementation, directory navigation, system design, and data analysis concepts.
