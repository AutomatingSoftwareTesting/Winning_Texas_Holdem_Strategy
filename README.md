# Winning Texas Hold'em Strategy

## Update Aug 2017 

Attending Skill Distillery Java bootcamp (Sept 2017 - Jan 2018) to learn about full stack web development. 

Want to someday release a more polished version of this as a Android mobile application developed using Java.

## What is it?

This is a No Limit Texas Hold'em (NLTH) Pre-flop Range Trainer. It gives a player random cards and a random position at the table. Then, the player has to decide if they would open or fold their hand. Finally, the application compares the player's decision to the correct decision based off of the selected hand range (which is customizable by the user).

## Additional Information

This project was created to help me demonstrate several skills I've acquired during my past several jobs.

Specifically, I've included: object oriented programming, automated testing, systems testing, functional development (variables, decisions, functions, loops), exception handling, report writing, project implementation, directory navigation, system design, and data analysis concepts.
