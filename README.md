# Winning Texas Hold'em Strategy

This project was created to help me demonstrate several skills I've acquired during my past several jobs.

## Program Overview

This is a No Limit Texas Hold'em (NLTH) Pre-flop Range Trainer. It gives a player random cards and a random position at the table. Then, the player has to decide if they would open or fold their hand. Finally, the application compares the player's decision to the mathematically correct decision based off of the selected hand range (which is customizable by the user).

## Installation

  * Hasn't been tested with Python 2; only 3.
* Additional modules / libraries:
  * 1st graphical user interface (gui) uses tkinter.
  * 2nd gui uses pyglet.
